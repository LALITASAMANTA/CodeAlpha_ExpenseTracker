# CodeAlpha_ExpenseTracker

An Expense Tracker page with a header, a form for adding transactions, a container for displaying balance, income, and expenses, a transaction history list, and a "Reset" & "Clear All" button. The JavaScript file "expense.js" likely handles the functionality of adding transactions and updating the display. The page uses external styling from "expense.css" and includes the Chart.js library for potential chart visualization, though the chart functionality is currently commented out.
